Investigation: {
Step 1: (Choose type)
- Quick
- Regular
- Thorough

Step 2: (See things to interact with, list of items/structures, changes with season, biome and time)
For example (Biome = Forest, Season = Spring, Time = Afternoon, factors when investigation is finished, so start at night and finish at morning = results as morning):
- 3x Small Rock
- 4x Small Tree
- 1x Large Tree
- 2x Tree Stump
- 2x Berry Bush
- 1x Yucca Plant

Step 3: (Choose a thing to interact with and get more options)
For example a rock or a tree:
(Small Rock):
- Pick up
- Look underneath

(Regular Oak Tree):
- Chop (requires axe)
- Shake (chance to drop acorn)
- Cut bark (requires knife)

Step 4 (Optional): (If option from step 3 has more options than repeat step 3 with new options)
(Step 3: Look underneath small rock):
Pile of critters/insects:
- Pick up

Step 5: (Go back to step 2 minus the already used resources)
